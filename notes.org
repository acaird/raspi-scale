* Readings

  - the readings are all very high; I think it needs a resistor, maybe.

* Wiring

  - I think the proper wiring is +3V to FSR_1 though FSR out FSR_2 to MCP3008
    pin 1, and this is where I think the resistor should go to ease up on the
    range.  Or something.  (This is in addition to the wriring instructions at
