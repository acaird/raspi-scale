* Readings

  - the readings are all very high; I think it needs a resistor, maybe.
    - nope, this was wrong, it just needed a pull-down resistor, not
      the resistor I was thinking of
  - now the readings are really nice

* Wiring

  - I think the proper wiring is +3V to FSR_1 though FSR out FSR_2 to MCP3008
    pin 1, and this is where I think the resistor should go to ease up on the
    range.  Or something.  (This is in addition to the wriring instructions at
    [[https://learn.adafruit.com/reading-a-analog-in-and-controlling-audio-volume-with-the-raspberry-pi/connecting-the-cobbler-to-a-mcp3008][learn.adafruit]]
    - this was also wrong

  - the correct thing is that it needed a pull-down resistor, as mentioned at
    https://learn.adafruit.com/force-sensitive-resistor-fsr/using-an-fsr

* Mechanics

  The mechanics of FSRs are tricky.  There are some web pages I had seen about
  this.  It is hard to get constant firm pressure on them.

  One approach that seems to work is:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE:

    coffee     |
    container  |
               |
  -------------+
           +--------+
           |  penny |
           +--------+
      +-------+
      |  fsr  +-------------- to breadboard
      +-------+
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  A photo of this set up is here:

      [[file:images/wires.jpg]]

  With that set up, 12oz of coffee changes the reading by between about 60 and
  100, which is a pretty narrow range.  With some better balance, it changes by
  about 200.

  I think this has become a mechanical engineering problem.

  I'm also thinking of something like this:

  #+BEGIN_SRC ditaa :file can-weight.png :cmdline --no-separation
