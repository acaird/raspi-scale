#+TITLE: Making a lame scale with a RaspberryPI and a force-sensitive resistor

* Motivation

  I wanted to make a little scale for my jar of coffee beans so I can plot
  the weight of it over time and note when it is low so I can buy fresh
  beans.

* The Script

  This script was taken from [[https://learn.adafruit.com/reading-a-analog-in-and-controlling-audio-volume-with-the-raspberry-pi/connecting-the-cobbler-to-a-mcp3008][learn.adafruit]] 
  and is also available at [[https://gist.github.com/ladyada/3151375#file-adafruit_mcp3008-py]]
  and modified a little to work with the FSR and not the potentiometer in their script.

* The Wiring

  Pretty soon I'll put up a diagram or something of the wiring.

* The License

  I don't know what the license on Adafruit's script is, but mine follows that.  If there isn't a license
  on their script, mine is [[http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/][CC By-SA]].
